  "recommendation_report": "This is a classic **\"Vision-Execution Gap\"** scenario. You have a founder who is intellectually in love with a future state (Vision: 5) but is currently drowning in a product that nobody is using (Traction: 1). \n\nWith 6 months of runway and a hardware component, BrainGlow is currently in the **\"Dead On Arrival\" zone** unless the focus shifts from engineering to behavioral validation immediately.\n\n---\n\n### 1. THE CORE HYPOTHESIS\n**Founder’s Claim:** \"Knowledge workers suffer from invisible 'cognitive drift' and will use EEG data to optimize focus.\"\n\n**The Harsh Reality:** Your evidence suggests the problem isn't \"invisible\"—it's **non-urgent**. \n*   **The Actual Hypothesis:** \"Knowledge workers are willing to endure the physical friction of a head-worn wearable and the cognitive load of data analysis because the resulting productivity gain is 10x better than caffeine or a Pomodoro timer.\"\n*   **Status:** **FAILED.** 5% weekly retention (5/100) indicates the value proposition does not outweigh the friction of wearing the device. You are building a \"Vitamin\" that requires the effort of a \"Surgery.\"\n\n### 2. THE \"KILL\" SIGNAL (Pivot Threshold)\nIf you cannot achieve **20% Weekly Active Usage (WAU)** among a specific, narrow sub-segment (e.g., Day Traders, Deep Work Developers) within **45 days**, you must pivot away from the \"General Productivity\" hardware play. \n*   *Rationale:* Hardware is too expensive to \"find\" a market. If 100 people signed up and only 5 stayed, the current iteration is a novelty, not a tool.\n\n### 3. VALIDATION EXPERIMENT BACKLOG\n\n*   **Technical Proof Point (Defensibility):**\n    *   **Experiment:** \"Closed-Loop Intervention.\" Can the device do more than *track*? (e.g., \"If Alpha waves drop, trigger a specific notification/sound that successfully resets focus\"). \n    *   **Goal:** Prove the hardware provides a *utility* that software/coffee cannot.\n*   **Market Proof Point (Willingness to Pay):**\n    *   **Experiment:** \"The Deposit Test.\" Send an email to the 100 signups offering a \"Beta Founder's Edition\" for a $50 non-refundable deposit.\n    *   **Goal:** If <3 people pay, your \"Low ARPU\" concern is a death sentence. You have no \"Willingness to Pay\" (WTP).\n\n### 4. DETECTION & ACTION TABLE\n\n| Pattern ID | Risk Pattern | Strength | Recommended Action | Evidence |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **FP-TEAM-001** | Founder Avoids Hard Job | 1.05 | Founder must conduct 20 \"Jobs to be Done\" interviews this week. Stop coding. | Technical founder, no sales experience, low retention. |\n| **FP-TRACTION-003** | Churn Hidden by Growth | 1.05 | Stop all new signups. Interview the 95 users who left. | 100 signups but only 5 active users. |\n| **FP-PROBLEM-001** | Nice-to-Have Problem | 1.05 | Reframe the product for a \"High-Stakes\" user (e.g., Surgeons, Pilots). | Users equate the problem to needing more coffee. |\n| **FP-ECON-001** | Burn Without Milestones | 1.05 | Freeze all non-essential spend until WTP is proven. | 6 months runway with no tested pricing. |\n\n### 5. RED FLAGS & EARLY WARNINGS (Weekly Monitor)\n1.  **WAU/MAU Ratio:** If this stays below 20%, your product is a \"one-time curiosity.\"\n2.  **Time to First Insight:** How many minutes of wearing the device until the user takes a *specific action* based on data? (Goal: <5 mins).\n3.  **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) vs. LTV:** Currently unmeasurable, but a red flag if you are considering paid ads now.\n4.  **Hardware Friction Score:** Qualitative feedback on \"Why did you take the headset off?\"\n5.  **Runway-to-Validation Ratio:** Days of cash left vs. number of \"No\"s received from customers.\n\n### 6. FUNDRAISING READINESS\n**Target: USD 500,000 | Assessment: NOT READY.**\n\nRaising $500k with 5 active users and a \"Nice-to-Have\" problem is a waste of time. No professional VC will touch this hardware play without:\n*   **Cohort Retention:** 4+ weeks of stable usage from a core group.\n*   **Hardware Unit Economics:** A clear path to 50% gross margins.\n*   **Sales Competence:** Proof that the solo founder can actually close a sale, not just collect \"interest.\"\n\n**Strategic Advice:** Stop building features. You are in a \"Product-Market Fit\" crisis, not a technical one. Spend the next 30 days proving that someone—anyone—considers \"Cognitive Drift\" a $500/year problem. If you can't, return the remaining capital or pivot to a software-only \"Focus Tracking\" play using existing sensors (webcam/keyboard).",
