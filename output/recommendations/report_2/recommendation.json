  "recommendation_report": "### **STRATEGIC MEMO: BRAINGLOW**\n**TO:** Founder, BrainGlow\n**FROM:** Strategic Advisor & Venture Scientist\n**SUBJECT:** Post-Mortem of Current Trajectory & Course Correction\n\nYour current state is the **\"Visionary Mirage.\"** You have a high-altitude narrative (Vision: 5) but ground-level execution is failing (Traction: 1, GTM: 1). Hardware is a graveyard for startups that mistake \"interest\" for \"utility.\" With 6 months of runway left, you are not building a product; you are conducting an expensive science experiment.\n\n---\n\n### **1. THE CORE HYPOTHESIS**\n*   **Founder’s Claim:** Knowledge workers suffer from invisible \"cognitive drift\" because they cannot visualize their real-time brainwave states to optimize focus.\n*   **The Reality (The \"Utility Gap\"):** Users don't buy \"alpha waves\"; they buy the *completion of a task.* Your evidence suggests the hardware friction (putting it on, calibrating) exceeds the perceived value of the data.\n*   **The Survival Hypothesis:** Knowledge workers will tolerate the discomfort of a wearable and pay >$300 if, and only if, the device provides a **forcing function** (e.g., auto-blocking notifications or physical haptic feedback) that results in a measurable 20% increase in output. *Visualization alone is a \"Nice-to-Have\" (FP-PROBLEM-001).*\n\n---\n\n### **2. THE \"KILL\" SIGNAL (Pivot Threshold)**\nIf, within the next **21 days**, you cannot convert **10 of your 100 signups** into \"Paid Beta\" users (at a price point that covers COGS + 20%) via direct 1-on-1 sales calls, **you must pivot or shut down.** \n*   *Why:* 5 weekly users from 100 signups is a 95% rejection rate. If you cannot sell this to the people who already said \"yes\" to the idea, the market for the current \"Focus Visualization\" framing does not exist.\n\n---\n\n### **3. VALIDATION EXPERIMENT BACKLOG**\n\n*   **Technical Proof Point (The \"Friction Test\"):**\n    *   **Goal:** Prove \"Time-to-Value\" (TTV) is under 60 seconds.\n    *   **Experiment:** Measure the time from \"I want to focus\" to \"Data is being recorded.\" If calibration takes >60 seconds, churn is inevitable. Use a stopwatch on your next 5 user sessions.\n*   **Market Proof Point (The \"Wallet Test\"):**\n    *   **Goal:** Validate \"Willingness to Pay\" (WTP) over \"Willingness to Try.\"\n    *   **Experiment:** Remove the \"Sign Up\" button. Replace it with a \"Pre-order for $199\" button. If the conversion rate drops to zero, your ICP is wrong or the problem isn't painful enough.\n\n---\n\n### **4. DETECTION & ACTION TABLE**\n\n| Pattern ID | Risk Pattern | Strength | Recommended Action | Evidence |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **FP-TEAM-001** | Founder Avoids Hard Job | 1.05 | Stop coding. Spend 100% of the next 2 weeks on Zoom sales calls. | 100 signups, 0 sales effort, technical founder bias. |\n| **FP-TRACTION-003** | Churn Hidden by Growth | 1.05 | Interview the 95 users who stopped using the device. | 5/100 WAU is a \"leaky bucket\" disaster. |\n| **FP-ECON-001** | Burn Without Milestones | 1.05 | Set a \"Hard Ceiling\" on hardware spend until 10 units are sold. | 6 months runway + hardware R&D = imminent death. |\n| **FP-PRODUCT-001** | No Core Use Case | 0.91 | Strip the app to ONE feature: \"Deep Work Timer with EEG Auto-Log.\" | Prototype features are \"unused.\" |\n| **FP-GTM-002** | Too Many Channels | 0.91 | Kill all social ads/content. Use Direct Outbound to 1 niche (e.g., Software Engineers). | \"Trying multiple channels\" with no results. |\n\n---\n\n### **5. RED FLAGS & EARLY WARNINGS (Weekly Monitor)**\n1.  **WAU / Total Units Shipped:** If this is <30%, your product is \"shelf-ware.\"\n2.  **Calibration Failure Rate:** % of sessions where the user gives up before data starts.\n3.  **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) vs. Deposit Amount:** Are you spending more to get a signup than the signup is worth?\n4.  **\"Time to First Focus State\":** How many minutes of use until the user sees a \"success\" notification?\n5.  **Direct Sales Conversion Rate:** Number of \"No's\" you personally hear per week. (If this is 0, you aren't selling).\n\n---\n\n### **6. FUNDRAISING READINESS**\n*   **Target Raise:** $500,000\n*   **Status:** **NOT READY.**\n*   **Hard Truth:** Investors do not fund \"Pre-seed Hardware\" with 5% retention and a solo technical founder who hasn't proven sales. At 6 months of runway, you are in the \"Death Zone.\" \n*   **Required for Raise:** You must show 10-20 \"Obsessed\" users (Daily Active Users) and a waitlist of 50 people who have paid a $50+ deposit. Without this, your $500k ask will be laughed out of the room as \"paying for a founder's hobby.\"\n\n**NEXT STEP:** Cancel all dev sprints for the next 14 days. Pick up the phone. Sell or die.",
