  "recommendation_report": "### **STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT: BRAINGLOW**\n**Status:** High-Risk / Vision-Execution Mismatch\n**Verdict:** BrainGlow is currently a \"Solution looking for a Problem.\" You are suffering from **Visionary Blindness**: your narrative is a 10, but your retention (5%) is a mathematical signal that your product is currently irrelevant to your users' daily workflow.\n\n---\n\n### **1. THE CORE HYPOTHESIS**\n*   **Founder’s Claim:** Knowledge workers will adopt and wear EEG hardware because visualizing cognitive drift (Alpha/Beta waves) is the missing link to productivity.\n*   **The Brutal Reality (Evidence-Based):** Productivity is an **outcome-based** market, not a **process-based** one. Users don't want to \"see waves\"; they want to \"finish their report in 2 hours instead of 4.\" \n*   **The Survival Hypothesis:** \"Knowledge workers in high-output roles (e.g., freelance coders, day traders) will pay >$300 for a device *only if* it provides an immediate, automated intervention (e.g., blocking notifications or changing music) that demonstrably extends their 'Deep Work' sessions by >20%.\"\n\n---\n\n### **2. THE \"KILL\" SIGNAL (Pivot Threshold)**\n**Trigger:** If you cannot move your Weekly Active Users (WAU) from 5 to 20 (20% of current signups) within 45 days without shipping a single new hardware feature.\n**Action:** If this fails, the hardware is a \"shelf-ware\" risk. You must pivot to a software-only \"Focus/Attention\" play or liquidate to preserve the remaining 6 months of runway.\n\n---\n\n### **3. VALIDATION EXPERIMENT BACKLOG**\n\n*   **Market Proof Point (Willingness to Pay):** \n    *   *Experiment:* Send a \"Pre-Order/Commitment\" email to the 100 signups. Offer a \"Pro\" version of the firmware/app for $20/mo or a $200 hardware upgrade.\n    *   *Success Metric:* 10% conversion. If they won't pay now, they won't pay later.\n*   **Technical Proof Point (Defensibility):** \n    *   *Experiment:* Correlation Study. Do the \"5 active users\" actually show higher output metrics? Map EEG data against a \"Kill the Distraction\" button. \n    *   *Success Metric:* A statistically significant correlation between BrainGlow use and session length compared to a control week.\n\n---\n\n### **4. DETECTION & ACTION TABLE**\n\n| Pattern ID | Risk Pattern | Strength | Recommended Action | Evidence |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **FP-TRACTION-003** | Churn Hidden by Growth | **CRITICAL** | Stop all acquisition. Interview the 95 users who left. | 5% WAU (5/100) is a \"leaky bucket\" disaster. |\n| **FP-TEAM-001** | Founder Avoids Hard Job | **HIGH** | You must spend 4 hours/day on Zoom sales calls/interviews. | Technical founder + 0 sales = building in a vacuum. |\n| **FP-PROBLEM-001** | Nice-to-Have Problem | **HIGH** | Frame the product as \"Income Protection\" for freelancers. | \"I drink coffee\" is your actual competitor. |\n| **FP-OPS-001** | No Operating Cadence | **MED** | Implement a Friday \"Demo or Die\" internal review. | Reactive execution with 6-month runway is fatal. |\n\n---\n\n### **5. RED FLAGS & EARLY WARNINGS (Weekly Monitor)**\n1.  **WAU/MAU Ratio:** If this stays below 10%, the product is a \"curiosity,\" not a \"utility.\"\n2.  **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) vs. Zero:** Since you aren't selling, any money spent on marketing is \"burning the furniture to keep warm.\"\n3.  **The \"Why I Quit\" Log:** You need a list of 50 specific reasons from the 95 churned users.\n4.  **Feature Usage Breadth:** If users only check the \"score\" and close the app, your EEG visualization is a vanity metric.\n5.  **Runway-to-Validation Ratio:** You have 24 weeks left. Each week without a sale is 4% of your company's life gone.\n\n---\n\n### **6. FUNDRAISING READINESS**\n*   **Target Raise:** USD 500,000\n*   **Advisor Verdict:** **NOT READY.** \n*   **Reasoning:** Hardware is capital-intensive. VCs look for \"Product-Market Fit\" (PMF) signals in hardware through pre-orders or obsessive retention. With 5 weekly users and a solo founder who hasn't tested pricing, a $500k raise is highly unlikely. \n*   **Fix:** Get 10 paid LOIs (Letters of Intent) or 20 highly active \"power users\" who use the device >3x per week. Without this, you are pitching a \"research project,\" not a \"startup.\"\n\n**Next Move:** Close your IDE. Open your email. Schedule 10 calls with the users who *stopped* using the device. Find out why you are a \"Nice-to-Have.\"",
