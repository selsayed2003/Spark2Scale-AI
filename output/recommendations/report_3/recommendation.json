  "recommendation_report": "### STRATEGIC MEMO: BRAINGLOW\n**TO:** Founder, BrainGlow\n**FROM:** Strategic Advisor / Venture Scientist\n**SUBJECT:** Post-Mortem of Current Trajectory & Validation Roadmap\n\n---\n\n### 1. THE CORE HYPOTHESIS\n**Founder’s Claim:** Knowledge workers suffer from invisible \"cognitive drift\" and will pay for/wear EEG hardware to visualize brainwave states (Alpha/Beta) for focus optimization.\n\n**The Reality Gap:** Your evidence suggests you are building a **solution in search of a problem.** \n*   **The \"Coffee\" Competitor:** Users view productivity through the lens of *energy*, not *neurology*. Coffee is a $5/day habit with zero friction and immediate feedback.\n*   **The \"Friction\" Tax:** Hardware has a high \"adoption tax.\" Your 5% retention rate (5/100 users) confirms that the \"value\" of seeing a brainwave does not outweigh the \"cost\" of wearing a headset.\n\n**Revised Core Hypothesis:** \"High-stakes performance professionals (e.g., Day Traders, Lead Devs) will tolerate head-mounted hardware because it provides a **quantifiable ROI on focus time** that outweighs existing chemical or software-only interventions.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. THE \"KILL\" SIGNAL (Pivot Threshold)\nIf, after **45 days** of targeting a specific, high-stakes ICP (e.g., Professional Day Traders), the **Week 1 Retention remains below 25%**, you must kill the current hardware form factor. \n*   *Logic:* If the \"desperate\" user won't wear it for a week, the mass-market \"knowledge worker\" never will.\n\n---\n\n### 3. VALIDATION EXPERIMENT BACKLOG\n\n*   **Technical Proof Point (Signal Integrity):** \n    *   *Experiment:* Test the EEG signal-to-noise ratio in a standard \"active\" environment (typing, drinking coffee, moving). \n    *   *Success Metric:* 90%+ data accuracy during movement. (If the data is \"dirty\" when the user is actually working, the feedback is a lie).\n*   **Market Proof Point (Willingness to Pay):** \n    *   *Experiment:* Launch a \"Paid Beta\" or Pre-order page targeting a specific niche (e.g., \"The Focused Coder Bundle\"). Price: $299.\n    *   *Success Metric:* 10 non-affiliated pre-orders with credit card deposits. (Signups are vanity; deposits are sanity).\n\n---\n\n### 4. DETECTION & ACTION TABLE\n\n| Pattern ID | Risk Pattern | Strength | Recommended Action | Evidence |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **FP-TRACTION-003** | Churn Hidden by Growth | **1.05** | **STOP ACQUISITION.** Interview the 95 users who left. Do not spend $1 on ads until you know why they quit. | 5/100 active users. |\n| **FP-PROBLEM-001** | Nice-to-Have Problem | **1.05** | Move from \"Brainwaves\" (Feature) to \"Deep Work Minutes\" (Outcome). People don't want EEG; they want 2 extra hours of work done. | \"I usually just drink coffee.\" |\n| **FP-TEAM-001** | Founder Avoids Hard Job | **1.05** | Founder must conduct 20 \"Jobs to be Done\" interviews this week. No more coding until the ICP is narrowed. | Solo founder/tech-heavy/no sales. |\n| **FP-ECON-001** | Burn Without Milestones | **1.05** | Freeze non-essential spend. Every dollar must go toward proving W1 Retention. | 6 months runway + hardware costs = Lethal. |\n\n---\n\n### 5. RED FLAGS & EARLY WARNINGS (Weekly Dashboard)\n*   **W1 Retention Rate:** (Critical) Target > 25%.\n*   **Average Session \"Wear-Time\":** Are they taking it off after 5 minutes? (Target: > 45 mins).\n*   **Time to \"Aha!\":** How many minutes from putting it on to receiving a *useful* focus intervention?\n*   **Customer \"No\" Count:** How many people explicitly said \"I won't pay for this\" this week? (Target: 10).\n*   **Cash Out Date:** Fixed date in the calendar, adjusted weekly.\n\n---\n\n### 6. FUNDRAISING READINESS\n**Target Raise:** $500,000 | **Current Status:** **NOT READY.**\n\n**Venture Scientist Assessment:** \nRaising $500k on 5 active users and a 5% retention rate is a \"Death March.\" You will be diluted to oblivion or rejected by 99% of VCs. \n*   **The Problem:** You have \"Vision\" (5/5) but \"Zero Evidence of Utility\" (1/5). \n*   **The Fix:** You don't need $500k to prove people want this; you need 10 users who love it so much they won't let you take the prototype back. \n*   **Recommendation:** Secure 10 \"Product Love\" case studies (W4 retention > 40%) before opening a data room. Hardware is too expensive to \"figure out\" after you take VC money.",
