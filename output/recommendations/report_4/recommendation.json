  "recommendation_report": "### **STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT: BRAINGLOW**\n**Status:** High Risk / Vision-Execution Gap\n**Verdict:** You are currently building a \"Science Project,\" not a \"Company.\" With 6 months of runway and a 5% retention rate, you are on a high-speed trajectory toward a \"quiet fail.\"\n\n---\n\n### **1. THE CORE HYPOTHESIS**\n\n*   **Founder’s Claim:** Knowledge workers suffer from invisible \"cognitive drift\" and will pay for/wear EEG hardware to visualize brainwave states (Alpha vs. Beta) to optimize focus.\n*   **The Evidence Reality:** There is a massive **Utility Gap**. \n    *   Users don't have a \"brainwave\" problem; they have a \"deadline/output\" problem. \n    *   Your evidence (5/100 WAU) suggests the hardware is currently a \"novelty toy.\" The \"Apple Watch\" objection indicates that the friction of wearing a headset is higher than the perceived value of the data provided.\n*   **The Critical Assumption:** Knowledge workers will adopt a \"work-outfit\" (hardware) and change their behavior based on data that—to them—is currently abstract and non-actionable. **This is currently unproven and trending toward \"False.\"**\n\n---\n\n### **2. THE \"KILL\" SIGNAL (Pivot Threshold)**\n\nIf, by **Day 60**, you cannot achieve a **40% Day-7 Retention rate** among a specific cohort (e.g., software engineers during deep-work blocks) WITHOUT you personally reminding them to wear the device, **kill the hardware-first model.** \n\n*   *Why:* If the 5 current users aren't obsessed, the next 500 won't be either. Lack of organic \"pull\" in hardware is fatal.\n\n---\n\n### **3. VALIDATION EXPERIMENT BACKLOG**\n\n*   **Market Proof Point (Willingness to Pay):** \n    *   *Experiment:* Launch a \"Pre-Order\" landing page with a $50 \"Priority Access\" deposit. \n    *   *Success Metric:* 20 deposits from non-friends within 14 days. \n    *   *Goal:* Prove this isn't a \"Nice-to-Have\" (Pattern FP-PROBLEM-001).\n*   **Technical Proof Point (Habit Formation):** \n    *   *Experiment:* \"The Coffee Test.\" For the 5 active users, ship a software update that triggers a \"Break Suggestion\" notification based on EEG drift. \n    *   *Success Metric:* 80% of users follow the prompt and report higher subjective focus in the next hour.\n    *   *Goal:* Move from \"Data Visualization\" to \"Active Intervention.\"\n\n---\n\n### **4. DETECTION & ACTION TABLE**\n\n| Pattern ID | Risk Pattern | Strength | Recommended Action | Evidence |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **FP-TEAM-001** | Founder Avoids Hard Job | 1.05 | Founder must conduct 20 \"Jobs to be Done\" interviews this week. Stop coding; start selling. | Technical founder, 0 sales exp, no GTM traction. |\n| **FP-TRACTION-003** | Churn Hidden by Growth | 1.05 | Stop all \"signup\" marketing. Interview the 95 users who quit. Why did they stop? | 100 signups vs. 5 WAU (95% churn). |\n| **FP-PRODUCT-001** | No Core Use Case | 0.91 | Strip the app to ONE feature: \"Deep Work Auto-Timer.\" Kill the rest. | Prototype built but features unused. |\n| **FP-ECON-001** | Burn Without Milestones | 1.05 | Freeze all non-essential spend. Every dollar must tie to \"Retention\" or \"WTP.\" | 6 months runway, low ARPU, no tested pricing. |\n\n---\n\n### **5. RED FLAGS & EARLY WARNINGS (Weekly Monitor)**\n\n1.  **D7 Retention:** If this stays below 20%, your product is a \"leaky bucket.\"\n2.  **Hardware Friction Score:** Time from \"Sitting at desk\" to \"EEG data flowing.\" If >30 seconds, users will stop using it by week 2.\n3.  **The \"So What?\" Metric:** Number of times a user changed their behavior (e.g., took a break, changed music) based on an EEG alert.\n4.  **Sales Conversion Rate:** Number of landing page visitors who click \"Buy/Pre-order\" vs. \"Learn More.\"\n5.  **Runway-to-Validation Ratio:** (Months of Runway) / (Time to next major proof point). If < 1.5, you are in the \"Danger Zone.\"\n\n---\n\n### **6. FUNDRAISING READINESS**\n\n**Target Raise:** USD 500,000\n**Current Status:** **NOT READY.**\n\n**The Brutal Truth:** No institutional investor will give you $500k for hardware with 5 weekly users and a solo technical founder who hasn't proven people will pay for it. You have \"Vision,\" but your \"Traction\" and \"GTM\" scores (1) are disqualifiers.\n\n**To get the $500k, you must first:**\n1.  **Prove Retention:** Get those 5 users to 20 users who use it 3x/week for a month.\n2.  **Prove Pricing:** Get 10-20 paid pre-orders to show the \"Nice-to-Have\" problem is actually a \"Must-Have.\"\n3.  **Fix the Founder Gap:** Either start selling today or find a Co-Founder who can handle GTM while you refine the hardware. \n\n**Advice:** Stop building features. Start talking to the 95 people who signed up and never came back. That is where your \"Product-Market Fit\" is buried.",
