    "explanation": "The problem is a 'Clear Pain' (Score 3). The web search provides strong validation for the core pain points of idea validation, business document creation, and investor outreach for early-stage founders. Multiple search results directly address challenges in validating startup ideas and the need for business plans and pitch decks. The frequency is stated as 'High' due to startup failure rates, and the impact is described as 'Time, Money, and Risk'. However, the score is capped at 3 due to the 'Market Education Risk' flag from the Risk Report, indicating that while the problem is real, educating the market on the specific solution might be challenging. Additionally, a deduction of 2 points was applied due to a significant 'Contradiction' identified in the Evidence Contradiction, where the general customer evidence ('market research' quote) does not strongly support the complex need described in the problem statement. The 'Audience Specificity Risk' and 'Clarity Risk' also contribute to a slightly lower score, suggesting areas for refinement.",

    "red_flags": [
      "Risk Report - Audience Specificity Risk: The customer profile is too broad, targeting 'Early-stage founders' without further segmentation.",

      "Contradiction Report - Evidence Contradiction: The problem statement describes a need for sophisticated tools, but the customer evidence ('market research' quote) is general and doesn't specifically validate this complex need.",
      "Contradiction Report - Scope Contradiction: The beachhead market ('Startup owners') is broader than the specific customer profile provided.",
      "Contradiction Report - Insider Contradiction: The claim of 'lived experience' cannot be substantiated due to missing 'prior_experience' data."

      "Problem Data - Frequency: The stated 'High' frequency, linked to startup failure rates, suggests a significant and recurring pain point.",
