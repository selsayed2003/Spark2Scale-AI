  "traction_report": {
    "score": "0/5",
    "explanation": "The startup scores a 0/5 due to a complete lack of validation signals. There are 0 users, 0 revenue, and no waitlist. The 'Contradiction Check' explicitly identifies a 'Validation Gap' and 'Zero Validation', noting that 12 interviews yielded no conversion to demand, indicating this is still an idea rather than a startup with proof of demand. The founding date is over 6 months ago with no shipping history, further reinforcing the 'Ghost Town' category.",
    "confidence_level": "High",
    "velocity_analysis": "Stagnant - The startup has been alive for over 7 months with no discernible progress in terms of user acquisition, revenue, or even a waitlist, indicating zero velocity.",
