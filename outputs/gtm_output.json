    "explanation": "Spark2Scale's Go-To-Market strategy is fundamentally flawed and lacks any realistic plan for customer acquisition. The 'Ghost Strategy Contradiction' highlights the critical issue of relying on 'Word of mouth' with zero users, indicating no traction. The 'Impossible Sales Contradiction' points to the unsustainable nature of 'Founder-led sales' for a freemium product with a $0 price point, which is also flagged by the Unit Economics report as an 'Insolvent Model'. The 'ICP Clarity Risk' further exacerbates this by defining an overly broad target audience. The combination of these factors, including the 'Strategy Vacuum Risk' and 'Sales Reality Risk', means there is no clear path to acquiring customers, let alone generating revenue.",
