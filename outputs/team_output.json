    "explanation": "The 'Contradiction Agent' identified a critical error: the 'start_date' is in the future relative to the current date. This makes the entire premise of the startup's existence and execution impossible at this time, resulting in a score of 0. Additionally, multiple high risks were identified, including a domain experience gap, cap table concerns, lack of founder-market fit alignment, vague clarity of thought, velocity risk due to no execution history, and insight risk regarding differentiation. The generic fit statements and limited experience of the founders further contribute to the low score.",
