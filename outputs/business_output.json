The 'Freemium' model with a price point of $0 and a 0% gross margin, as highlighted by the 'Profitability Calc' and 'Contradiction Check', renders the business a charity project with no path to revenue or sustainability. The 'runway_months' of 0, confirmed by both internal data and forensic reports, signifies immediate bankruptcy. This aligns directly with the 'No Monetization Logic (Disqualified)' criteria of the scoring rubric.",
