    "explanation": "The market size and entry strategy are fundamentally flawed, leading to a score of 0/5. The 'Ghost Market Alert' highlights a critical contradiction: a 'Freemium' model with zero price in a potentially niche market (early-stage founders, 2-50 people) cannot generate venture-scale revenue. The 'David vs. Goliath Alert' points to a lack of defensibility against powerful incumbents like OpenAI, with no clear moat identified. The TAM verification, while showing a large number of entrepreneurs globally, does not validate a *specific, monetizable beachhead* for this zero-price offering. The 'Regulation & Trend Radar' indicates AI is a major economic driver, but this doesn't offset the core business model issues. The 'Dependency Analysis' failure suggests potential platform risks, though the primary failure lies in the economic viability and competitive positioning.",
