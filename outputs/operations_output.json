    "explanation": "This startup is fundamentally uninvestable today. The cap table is a critical failure, with founders holding only 40% equity at the Seed stage, indicating 'dead equity' and a severe misalignment of incentives. Furthermore, the complete lack of financial data (monthly burn, runway, gross margin) renders any assessment of operational readiness impossible. The stated use of funds is an empty array, and the $5M round target is a delusion without any supporting financial projections or milestones. This is a 'Ghost Ship' scenario where the operational plan is entirely absent, and the financial health is a black box.",
