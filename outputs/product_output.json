    "score": "0/5",
    "explanation": "The startup is scored 0/5 due to a complete lack of verifiable product evidence. The 'product.status' is claimed as 'Live / MVP', but the 'shipping_history' is empty, and no 'visuals' are available. The 'Forensic Tool Reports' explicitly state 'Execution Failure' due to the absence of shipping history and visuals. Furthermore, the 'Feasibility Risk' highlights that no website link, demo, or screenshots were found in external search results, contradicting the claim of a 'live product'. The 'Time-Traveler Mismatch' also flags a null 'date_founded', making timeline assessment impossible. The 'Resource Mismatch' points out a 'Deep Tech / Heavy AI Model' moat with '$0 / Bootstrapped' funding, which is highly improbable. The 'Defensibility Risk' and 'Differentiation Risk' indicate a generic moat and a crowded market with no clear 10x improvement, further solidifying the 'Me-too Solution' or 'No Product' assessment.",

      "Defensibility Risk: Product's 'moat' is described as generic, with established platforms offering similar functionalities.",

      "Value Proposition Risk: Solution appears to be a 'vitamin' rather than a 'painkiller' due to readily available free resources."
